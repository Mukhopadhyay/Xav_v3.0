        <p>St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Kolkata has been a platform for the finest talents and brightest minds of
            the
            country. The Xaverian spirit of ‘Nihil Ultra’ or Nothing Beyond has been a guiding force behind every member
            of
            the Xaverian family. This guiding force has always inspired Xaverians to explore the riches in a world of
            limitless possibilities and thus we aim to create and enter newer avenues of excellence with ‘XAVOTSAV 2019’
            to
            be held on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th of January, 2019. XAVOTSAV is the annual cultural extravaganza organized
            by
            the St. Xavier’s College Students’ Council. It has events spread across various spectrums such as performing
            arts, fine arts, literature, lifestyle and sports. Year after year our resolve to make Xavotsav bigger and
            better only strengthens. The likes of The Raghu Dixit Project, Nucleya, Papon and East India Company,
            Euphoria,
            Hard Kaur, Lost Stories, Agnee, Shirley Setia, Marnkik, and Sevenn have set the stage on fire in the past.
            The
            Council has initiated new fests such as Vincion for students with artistic skills. Every endeavour that St.
            Xavier’s college Kolkata takes is backed by the vision of productivity contributing to the society. The
            Council
            has also organized events such as Xavier’s Premier League, a five-a-side football tournament to encourage
            unpraised talent in football. The Council also strives to influence the academic sphere by organizing events
            such as Debates involving students, teachers and the meritorious Alumni/ae of the college. It is indeed a
            matter
            of pride to have the participation of prestigious colleges in Xavotsav 2019 – “A Rainbow of Dreams&quot;
            which
            will not only foster a sense of competition, fraternity and cooperation among all participating
            institutions,
            but will also act as a platform for unrecognized talent. It would be our privilege to have the creative
            vibrancy
            of the students
            from your esteemed Institution add to the overall effervescence of Xavotsav 2019.</p>
