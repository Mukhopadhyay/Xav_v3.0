                    HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO TRANSFIX AND MESMERIZE THEM? STAGE PLAY IS THE EVENT WHERE YOU BRING OUT THE
                    FLAIR FOR THEATRE INSIDE YOU, AND IGNITE THE PROSCENIUM WITH YOUR NONPAREIL EXHIBITION. CHANNELIZE
                    THE COLLECTIVE ACUMEN OF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN A THEATRE TROUPE, AND PRODUCE A PLAY WHICH WILL HOLD
                    EVERY WITNESS TO THRALL. DRAMATIZE WITH DIGNITY AND CATER TO THE SENSIBILITIES OF THE AUDIENCE.

                    THE SHARPEST WEAPON YOU HAVE IS YOUR VOICE. MOULD YOUR VOICE, USE YOUR INNER BEAST TO MAKE A VOICE
                    COME ALIVE AND SHOWCASE A PICTURE. NO VISUAL ONLY ACOUSTIC, NO GESTURE ONLY SOUND EFFECTS. USE YOUR
                    VOICE TO CALL a SPADE A SPADE AND MAKE EVEN THE GREAT SENECA PROUD. DIALOGUE CAN BE REVOLUTIONARY,
                    YOU JUST NEED TO SAY IT RIGHT.<br />
