                That's a ridiculous age for a Bengali to get married, unless the girl is pregnant. Going by the really
                smart decision making he had displayed in life, comedy was the next logical move. He likes to talk about
                his inter community marriage, corporate life, politics (because Bengali), Facebook and various current
